# YOLOv7 Object Detection Setup and Inference

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to setting up your Python environment for running YOLOv7 object detection and displaying inference results on images.

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/yolov7-setup.git](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.git)
cd yolov7
content_copy

Use code with caution.
Markdown
## 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python3 -m venv yolov7-env
source yolov7-env/bin/activate
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

This will install essential libraries like:

PyTorch

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

4. Download YOLOv7 Weights

Download the YOLOv7 weights file (e.g., yolov7.pt) from the official YOLOv7 repository: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

Place the downloaded weights file (yolov7.pt) in the root directory of this project.

5. Run Inference
python detect.py --source path/to/your/image.jpg --weights yolov7.pt
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to your image file.

Optional Arguments:

--conf-thres: Confidence threshold for detection (default: 0.25).

--iou-thres: IoU threshold for non-max suppression (default: 0.45).

--view-img: Show the detection results in a window (add the flag to enable).

6. Results

The detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and labels on the input image. If --view-img is enabled, the inference result will be displayed in a window. Otherwise, the output image will be saved in the runs/detect/ directory.

Notes

You might need to adjust the requirements.txt file depending on your system configuration and CUDA version.

For detailed information about YOLOv7 and its usage, refer to the official repository: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7

**Important:**

- Replace `your-username/yolov7-setup.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
- Make sure you have a `detect.py` file in your project that handles image loading, model inference, and result visualization.
- If you encounter issues with CUDA or GPU availability, you might need to install the appropriate CUDA toolkit and PyTorch version that supports your GPU.
